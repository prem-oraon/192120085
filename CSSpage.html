        <h1>CSS</h1>
        
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation 
            of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology 
            of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, 
            and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and 
            control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share 
            formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and 
            repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve 
            the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

            <h2>Advantages of CSS</h2>
            <pre>
            • The use of CSS separates document layout from document content.
            
            – Different people can be responsible for the two parts.
            
            – Document author can focus on content.
            
            – Graphic designer can focus on layout.
            
            • A single file can control the look of an entire web site.
            
            – Easy to modify look of web site without affecting its contents.
            
            – Easy to obtain a consistent look (the R in CRAP)
            
            • If done correctly, documents degrade gracefully on platforms that
             don't support visual formatting.
            </pre>

            <h2>Disadvantages of CSS</h2>
            <pre>
            • More to learn
            – CSS is powerful but complex.
            
            • Not fully supported on some browsers
            – Even some modern browsers are not fully CSS 2 compliant.
            
            • The formatting is separated from the document
            – Makes it hard to write a document and format it simultaneously.
            </pre>

            <h2>How to Write a Document</h2>
            <pre>

            <h4> 1.Decide what you want to write</h4>
            ● First and foremost the content of the document is important.
            
            ● Decide on the logical structure of the document.
            
           <h4> 2.Write it</h4>
            ● Write the document content.
            
            ● Markup the document's logical structure.
            
           <h4> 3.Format it</h4>
            ● Use CSS to do formatting
            
            ● Add other formatting-specific data (e.g., navigation).
            
            ● Points 1 and 2 should take the majority of the time.

           <h2> Using CSS</h2>
           <pre>
            • There are three ways to use CSS.
            
            <h3>• External Style Sheets</h3>
            – Uses the LINK tag (in the document HEAD)
            
            link rel=”stylesheet” href=”../morin.css” type=”text/css”
            
           <h3> • Inline Style Sheets</h3>
            – The STYLE tag (in the document HEAD)
            
            style type=”text/css”
            
            CSS information goes here
            
            style
            
            <h4>CSS with Class</h4>
            • (Almost) all HTML tags can have an optional.
            
            CLASS attribute
            • This works nicely in conjunction with CSS:
            
            style type=”text/css”>
            
            p.blogentry {
            
            font-size: 12pt;
            
            font-family: “Luxi Serif”, serif;
            
            }
            
            /style>
            
            ...
            Today was the best day ever ...
            
            <h4>CSS with IDs</h4>
            • Similarly, almost all HTML tags can have an ID.
            
            attribute:
            style type=”text/css”>
            
            #menubar {
            
            font-size: 12pt;
            
            font-family: “Luxi Serif”, serif;
            
            }
            
            /style>
            
            ...
            Item 1
            ...
            <h4>Notes on CLASS and ID</h4>
            • Use CLASS when a document contains (or may contain) many items of this type.
            
            – E.g.: blogEntry, nameList, properName.
            
            • Use ID when a document can only contain one item of this type.
            
            – E.g. pageTitle, mainNavigationBar
            
            • Choose CLASS and ID names wisely.
            
            – Good: Pat Morin.
            
            – Bad: Pat Morin
            
            <h4>The DIV and SPAN tags</h4>
            • HTML has 2 tags, DIV and SPAN, that are.
            
            specifically used with CSS and CLASS and ID attributes.
            
            • A DIV tag contains a block of text.
            
            – Like a paragraph, section heading, or title.
            
            • A SPAN tag contains a short piece of text within a block
            
            – Like a proper name, or a dollar amount.
            
            <h3>Example of DIV and SPAN</h3>
            On his way to school,
            
            Uncle Rico
            
            stopped at the local groceteria and spent.
            
            $4.55 on milk, bread, and honey.
            
            This document was written by.
            
            Pedro Sanchez
            
            on Jan. 9th, 2007.
            
            Typeface: font-family
            • Consists of a comma-separated list of font names.
            
            h1 { font-family: “Times New Roman”,
            
            “ Luxi Serif”,
            
            “ DejaVu LGC Serif”,
            
            serif;
            
            }
            
            • Not all fonts are available on all systems.
            
            – Browser will try fonts in order that they are specified.
            
            • Always make the last option one of the generic
            
            fonts: serif, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy, or monospace
            
            Font Size: font-size
            • Specified in one of the CSS size units.
            
            – 1em is the width of a letter m (relative to surrounding text).
            
            – 1pt is a standard typographic point (1/72 inches)
            
            – 1px is one screen pixel.
            
            – Keywords: xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large are browser dependant
            
            – Percentages: XXX% relative to the surrounding code.
            
            • Points and pixels are extremely accurate but not resizeable
            
            h1 { font-size: 200%; }
            
            h2 { font-size: large; }
            
            h3 { font-size: medium; }
            
            Bold Fonts: font-weight
            • Can be one of normal, bold, bolder,
            
            lighter, 100, 200, ..., 900
            
            h1 { font-weight: bold;
            
            font-size: 200%;
            
            }
            
            h2 { font-weight: bold;
            
            font-size: medium;
            
            }
            
            The Font Style: font-style
            • Can be one of normal, italic, or oblique.
            
            • An italic font is usually slanted and maybe has
            
            .some curls added
            • An oblique font is a skew transformation of a regular font (not well supported)
            
            em { font-style: italic; }
            
            h1 { font-family: sans-serif;
            
            font-weight: bold;
            
            font-style: italic;
            
            }
            
            Other Font Properties
            • Use font-variant for producing small caps.
            
            • Use font-stretch to expand or condense a font
            
            • Use font as a shorthand to set all font properties at once
            
            h1 { font: italic
            
            small-caps
            
            bold 12pt sans-serif;
