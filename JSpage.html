        <h1>JAVA SCRIPT</h1>
       
        <p>JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language
		which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, 
		full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites
		when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding
		programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser.
		Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers.
		With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly 
		without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide
		several forms of interactivity and simplicity.

        <h2>JavaScript Keywords</h2>
        <pre>
            -JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to 
             identify the JavaScript action to be performed
            -Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn
            1. break	->Terminates a switch or a loop
            2. continue	->Jumps out of a loop and starts at the top
            3. debugger	->Stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available)
                          the debugging function
            4. do ... while	->Executes a block of statements, and repeats the block,
                              while a condition is true
            5. for	->Marks a block of statements to be executed, as long as a condition
                 is true
            6. function	->Declares a function
            7. if ... else	->Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on a
                          condition
            8. return	->Exits a function
            9. switch	->Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on
                      different cases
            10. try ... catch	->Implements error handling to a block of statements
            11. var	->Declares a variable
        </pre>

            <h2>JavaScript Operators</h2>
            <pre>
                -JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values.
            </pre>
<hr>
            <h2>JavaScript Expressions</h2>
            <pre>
                -An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators,
                 which computes to a value.
                -The computation is called an evaluation.
                <h3>Example</h3>
                5 * 10 evaluates to 50
            </pre>
<hr>
            <h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>
            <pre>
                -All JavaScript statements are "executed".
                -Code after double slashe // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
                -Comments are ignored, and will not be executed.
            </pre>            
<hr>
            <h2>JavaScript Data Types</h2>
            <pre>
                -JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings,
                 objects and more.
                 <h3>Example</h3>
                length = 16;                               // Number
                lastName = "Johnson";                      // String
                x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};    // Object
            </pre>
<hr>
            <h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>
            <pre>
                -A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform
                 a particular task.
                -A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3,.......) {
                    // code to be executed
                  }
                <h3>Example</h3>
                function myFunction(p1, p2) {
                    return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
                  }
                <h4>Function Return</h4>
                -When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop
                 executing.
                 <h3>Example</h3>
                 var x = myFunction(4, 3);   // Function is called

                function myFunction(a, b) {
                return a * b;             // Function returns the product of a and b
                }
            </pre>      
<hr>
            <h2>Array</h2>
            <pre>
                -An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one
                 value at a time.
                -If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example),
                 storing the cars in single variables 
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                var array_name = [item1, item2, ...];
                <h3>Example</h3>
                var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
            </pre>
<hr>
            <h2>Statement</h2>
            <pre>
                <h4>Switch Statement</h4>
                The switch statement is used to perform different actions
                 based on different conditions
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                switch(expression) {
                    case x:
                      // code block
                      break;
                    case y:
                      // code block
                      break;
                    default:
                      // code block
                  }
                <h4>break Keyword</h4>
                -When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the
                 switch block.
                -This will stop the execution of inside the block.
                -It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block.
                 The block breaks (ends) there anyway.
            </pre>
<hr>
            <h2>Loops</h2>
            <pre>
                -Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over
                 and over again, each time with a different value.
                -JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
                1. for - loops through a block of code a number of times
                2. for/in - loops through the properties of an object
                3. for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
                4. while - loops through a block of code while a specified
                 condition is true
                5. do/while - also loops through a block of code while a
                 specified condition is true
                <h4>For Loop</h4>
                The for loop has the following syntax:
                for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
                    // code block to be executed
                  }
                <h4>For/In Loop</h4>
                The JavaScript for/in statement loops through the properties of an object
                for (variable in iterable) {
                    // code block to be executed
                  }
                <h4>For/Of Loop</h4>
                for (variable of iterable) {
                    // code block to be executed
                  }
                <h4>While Loop</h4>
                The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified
                 condition is true
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                while (condition) {
                    // code block to be executed
                  }
                <h4>Do/While Loop</h4>
                The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will
                 execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is
                 true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                do {
                    // code block to be executed
                  }
                  while (condition);
            </pre>
  <hr>
            <h2>JavaScript Classes</h2>
            <pre>
              -Use the keyword class to create a class.
              -Always add a method named constructor():
              <h3>Syntax</h3>
              class ClassName {
                constructor() { ... }
              }
              <h4>Class Methods</h4>
              -Class methods are created with the same syntax as object methods.
              -Use the keyword class to create a class.
              -Always add a constructor() method.
              -Then add any number of methods
              <h3>Syntax</h3>
              class ClassName {
                constructor() { ... }
                method_1() { ... }
                method_2() { ... }
                method_3() { ... }
                }
              }
            </pre>
